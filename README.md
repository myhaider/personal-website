# Myra's Personal Site
This was my very first practical project with HTML/CSS. I had never taken any classes on web design before, so I thought teaching myself would be a nice hobby for the summer. It's still under major construction, but you can check out my progress at http://acsweb.ucsd.edu/~myhaider/. My next big plan is to implement Bootstrap to make the layout more responsive.
