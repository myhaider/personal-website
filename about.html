				<h2 class="about-title">Myra Haider</h2>
				<p></p>

				<p> I am a student who is proud to be apart of the first class of undergrad Data Science majors here at UCSD. I enjoy dreaming up new ways of discovering the world through data, as well as being involved on campus as a student leader. One day I hope to make a big impact on this planet. Maybe another if I’m lucky.</p>

				<h4>Goals & Education</h4>

				<p>I am enrolled in <a href="http://sixth.ucsd.edu/">Sixth College</a>, where I am pursuing a B.S. in Data Science and a minor in Cognitive Science. Before that, I graduated from Laguna Hills High School with honors in 2017. </p>

				<p>I am a member of the <a href="https://open.nasa.gov/explore/datanauts/"> NASA Datanauts</a>, a group that encourages collaboration amongst data scientists and advocacy for women in the field. Although I love being apart of this global community, I am also passionate about supporting right here in San Diego. </p>

				<p>I served as Sixth College Senator at <a href="https://as.ucsd.edu/">ASUCSD</a>, the university’s main governing body. I acted as the liaison between <a href="https://sixth.ucsd.edu/student-life/involvement-opportunities/student-council/index.html">Sixth College Student Council</a> and AS Senate, and worked with my fellow senators to serve thousands of students throughout the term.</p>

				<p>Currently, I am the Technology Director for <a href="http://www.wintergamefest.org/classified#intro-1">Sixth College Technology Committee</a>. I lead an amazing team that is in charge of planning events relating to gaming and tech, most notably <a href="http://www.wintergamefest.org/">Winter Gamefest</a>, the largest student-run gaming convention on the west coast.</p>

				<h4>Interests</h4>
				<p>I’m an R and Tableau enthusiast who was born and raised in sunny soCal. I spend lots of time exploring San Diego, especially hiking trails and new foodie spots. I also love reading about the latest news in astronomy, computer animation, and soccer.</p>
